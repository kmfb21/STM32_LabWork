C335 will explore how programs written in a high level language are evaluated by a processor to control the physical world.
This semester we will be using a laboratory based upon the **STM32 (ARM Cortex-M4) processor** and utilizing off-the-shelf modules
 -- these and many other modules are readily available from on-line suppliers.
We will use **"C"** to write programs to control these modules including an LCD display, a serial interface, a Wii Nunchuk, and an audio amplifier.
