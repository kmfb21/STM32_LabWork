Q1)
It has two pins: SDA and SCL
volts are from 2.16V to 3.6V
The accelerometer/magnetometer is between user_input and reset button

Q2)
after we send data to them, i2c can know which one is accelerometer and which one is magnetometer, so that it can control them.

Q3)
the loop is reading x,y,z axis by shifting buffer and save it to accel_data[i]

Difficulties:

it was difficult to understand how to translate acceleration to pitch and roll
but much easier at compass part.

I learned how to use pitch and roll drawing a ball scrolling on the screen.
