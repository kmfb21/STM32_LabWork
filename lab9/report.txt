Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?
Because pb6 and pb7 are initialized in other files which are done in last labs

Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?

is the f3d_nunchuk_read's us the *n as a pointer to do the structure dereference to z and c flag in the switch part, which implies the the communication in this function is using pointer to switch the properties of the nunchuk.

Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?

typedef struct nunchuk_data { 
  unsigned char jx; //the bar's x axis
  unsigned char jy; //the bar's y axis
  unsigned short ax; // the analog x axis.
  unsigned short ay; // the analog y axis
  unsigned short az; // the analog z axis
  unsigned char c; // the c button
  unsigned char z; // the z button
} nunchuk_t; 

Q4) switch (data[5] & 0x03) {
  case 2:
    n->z = 1;
    n->c = 0;
    break;
  case 1:
    n->z = 0;
    n->c = 1;
    break;
  case 0:
    n->z = 1;
    n->c = 1;
    break;
  case 3:
    n->z = 0;
    n->c = 0;
    break;
  }

the data[5] is the button c in the nunchuk data and the different cases represents the time 
that we click on the button, and do the bitwise AND with 0x03 for each cases, and the different
 cases set different flag to the data[5]

difficulties: I had troubles displaying nunchuk data but finally solve it by configuring that it is similar to accel_data.
