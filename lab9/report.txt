Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?
Because pb6 and pb7 are initialized in other files which are done in last labs

Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?


Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?
  unsigned char jx;//bar's x axis
  unsigned char jy;//bar's y axis
  unsigned short ax;//analog x axis.
  unsigned short ay;//analog y axis
  unsigned short az;//analog z axis
  unsigned char c;//c button
  unsigned char z;//z button

Q4)
we use data[5] & 0x03 to get last two bits of data[5]
c is the last bit, z is second last bit
so 0b00 -> z:0 c:0
0b01 -> z:0 c:1
0b10 -> z:1 c:0
0b11 -> z:1 c:1

difficulties: the range of accel of nunchuck is different from that in board,
so it took us some time to fix it.
