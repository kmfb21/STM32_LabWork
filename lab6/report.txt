Questions [3 points each]
What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
CS(SS) is "slave select"
All communication is controlled by the master,
which selects the slave it wishes to communicate with by lowering the appropriate SS line.

Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations?
What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
Because when CS is low we read or write data, which is set in our functions, from low to high
otherwise, we need it high. so after initializing, we immediately set it high

How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
We connect PA5 and SCK, PA6 and MISO, PA7 MOSI

The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to?
What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
a prescaler of 8 results in a 3MHz SPI clock (24/8).
We use prescaler of 64, 8, and 2 for slow, medium, and fast speeds, respectively.

Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)?
Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
Yes
Because it is needed in our program every time.

Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had [5]:
We have some settings wrong in our initial function, it caused our output always 0.000
But we thought the bug was in our gyro_write function, so it wastes a lot of time for us to debuging a correct place for many times.
