1) What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?
  Flash

2) What does GPIO stand for?
  General Purpose I/O

3) Is the provided delay function accurate? Why or why not?
  Not accurate. Using for loop to delay depends on how fast our machine is.

4) What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?
  Pin 15 and Pin 11
  Port R44 and R43

5) What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?

GPIO_Pin
GPIO_Mode
GPIO_OType
GPIO_Speed
GPIO_PuPd

Were there any difficulties? If not, what did you learn? [5 points]

So difficult to understand how all program works since privious C program never has endless while loop.
And it takes much time to understand struct GPIO_InitTypeDef
